        The useSearchParams hook is used to read and modify the query string in
        the URL for the current location. Like React's own useState hook,
        useSearchParams returns an array of two values: the current location's
        search params and a function that may be used to update them. Just as
        React's useState hook, setSearchParams also supports functional updates.
        Therefore, you may provide a function that takes a searchParams and
        returns an updated version.The useSearchParams hook is used to read and
